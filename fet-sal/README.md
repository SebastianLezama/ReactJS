# Front End Test

Hello there! First of all thank you for the opportunity to showcase some of my skills. Let me tell you that I've had some problems with the **Swiper** library and couldn't get the _navigation module_ to show the arrows. As I only had a day or so to work on this I've set my own in place and moved on to finish the project.

Thanks! Bye!
